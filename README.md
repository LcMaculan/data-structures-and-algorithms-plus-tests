# (Data Structures and Algorithms) plus Tests
Working in progress.

Collection of data structures and algorithms with tests for personal learning purpose.

Using Mono and NUnit.

## Prepare environment
```bash
cd c_sharp
bash prepare.sh
```

## Run algorithm
```bash
cd c_sharp
bash run.sh {{ALGORITHM_NAME}}
```
example:
```bash
cd c_sharp
bash run.sh bst
```

## Algorithms
- [x] [Breadth First Search (bfs)](./c_sharp/bfs/main.cs)
- [x] [Depth First Search (dfs)](./c_sharp/dfs/main.cs)
- [x] [Disjoint Set List (disjoint_set_list)](./c_sharp/disjoint_set_list/main.cs)
- [x] [Disjoint Set Tree (disjoint_set_tree)](./c_sharp/disjoint_set_tree/main.cs)
- [x] [Linked List (linked_list)](./c_sharp/linked_list/main.cs)
- [x] [Binary Search Tree (bst)](./c_sharp/bst/main.cs)
- [X] [Heap](./c_sharp/heap/main.cs)
