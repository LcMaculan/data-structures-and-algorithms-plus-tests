# (Data Structures and Algorithms) plus Tests
Working in progress.

Collection of data structures and algorithms with tests for personal learning purpose.

Using Mono and NUnit.

## Prepare environment
```bash
cd c_sharp
bash prepare.sh
```

## Run algorithm
```bash
cd c_sharp
bash run.sh {{ALGORITHM_NAME}}
```
example:
```bash
cd c_sharp
bash run.sh bst
```
